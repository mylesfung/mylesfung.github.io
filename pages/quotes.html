          <p>"That's the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet."</p> 
          <p>- Jhumpa Lahiri, <i>The Namesake</i></p>

          <p>
              "When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more 
              than you do about what's worth paying attention to."
          </p>
          <p>- Paul Graham</p>
      </li>
      <li>

        <p>"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. 
          Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing."</p>
          <p>- Helen Keller</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

            "The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, 
            and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, 
            in myriad, petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom."
        </p>
        <p>- David Foster Wallace, <i>This Is Water: Some Thoughts, Delivered on a Significant Occasion, 
            about Living a Compassionate Life</i></p>
