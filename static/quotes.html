                "When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more 
                than you do about what's worth paying attention to."
            </p>
            <p>- Paul Graham</p>

                “It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously 
                that you might as well not have lived at all—in which case, you fail by default.”

                and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, 
                in myriad, petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom."
            </p>
